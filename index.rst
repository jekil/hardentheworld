About the project
*****************

Every day many people, including me, waste time googling for procedures, configurations and a way to harden their
services.
So I created Harden the World in the hope to start a community project focused on developing common guidelines and best practices to deploy secure configurations.
This repository contains hardening guidelines for devices, applications and OSs.
