OpenSSH
-------

According to `OpenSSH official website <https://www.openssh.com/>`_ OpenSSH is used *"OpenSSH is a free version of the
SSH connectivity tools that technical users of the Internet rely on. Users of telnet, rlogin, and ftp may not realize
that their password is transmitted across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all traffic
(including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.
Additionally, OpenSSH provides secure tunneling capabilities and several authentication methods, and supports all
SSH protocol versions"*.
Different versions of OpenSSH support different options which are not always compatible. This guide show settings for the most commonly deployed OpenSSH versions.

.. contents::
   :local:

Change port number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH default port (22/tcp) is a service target of worms, script kiddies, and all kind of brute forcing around.
It is suggested to edit *sshd_config* file (usually located in */etc/ssh/sshd_config*) to run the SSH daemon on a non default
port, using the *Port* option::

    Port 34567

Compression after authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to enable compression only after authentication.
Open *sshd_config* (usually located in */etc/ssh/sshd_config*) and make sure following value is configured::

    Compression delayed

Configure Idle Log Out Timeout Interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can login to server via ssh, it is suggested to set an idle timeout interval to avoid unattended ssh session.
Open *sshd_config* (usually located in */etc/ssh/sshd_config*) and make sure following values are configured::

    ClientAliveInterval 300
    ClientAliveCountMax 0

Enable strict mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using strict mode you can enforce some checks on important files inside users' home directory have the proper privileges
and ownership, SSH daemon will only allow a remote user to log on if checks pass.
It is suggested to enable strict mode editing *sshd_config* file and enabling *StrictModes*::

    StrictModes yes

Enable a Warning Banner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set a warning banner by updating *sshd_config* with the following line::

    Banner /etc/issue

This setting is suggested *only* on intranet facing servers. If you are using a custom banner on an internet facing
system you are disclosing some kind of information and it is quite easy to fingerprint and track your system.
For example think about your "fingerprint prone" SSH server published as an hidden node. Anyone could correlate the
unique banner with you.

Disable .rhosts Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH can be configured to emulate the behavior of the obsolete rsh command honoring *.rhosts* files.
This is historically unsafe and it is suggested to disable it, edit *sshd_config* file and disable *IgnoreRhosts*::

    IgnoreRhosts yes

Disable Challenge Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should also disable challenge-response authentication, in case your version of OpenSSH is using PAM to authenticate.
It is suggested to edit *sshd_config* file and disable *ChallengeResponseAuthentication*::

    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

Disable Empty Passwords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to explicitly disallow remote login from accounts with empty passwords, update *sshd_config* with the following
line::

    PermitEmptyPasswords no

Disable gateway for forwarded ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH binds local port forwardings to the loopback address only, as default.
This is a security feature to prevent other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.
The *GatewayPorts* option can be used to specify if this is the expected behaviour.
It is suggested to disable *GatewayPorts*, it is already disabled by default in most distributions, edit *sshd_config*
file and disable *IgnoreRhosts*::

    GatewayPorts no

Disable Host-Based Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to disable host-based authentication, as *.rhost* based authenticaiton, it is not rock solid authentication.
To disable host-based authentication, edit *sshd_config* file and disable *HostbasedAuthentication*::

    HostbasedAuthentication no

Disable Password Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default SSH can use keys or password to provide authentication, passwords are prone to brute force attacks.
It is suggested to use keys only and completely disable password-based logins.
To stop password based authentication, edit *sshd_config* file and disable *PasswordAuthentication*::

    PasswordAuthentication no

Disable Protocol 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The legacy SSH protocol 1 is not secure: it suffers of man-in-the-middle attacks and it has a myriad of vulnerabilities;
it should be disabled although in most cases it already is
by default.
It is suggested to edit *sshd_config* file and add the following line to use only SSH protocol version 2::

    Protocol 2

Disable Roaming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenSSH has some undocumented, and rarely used features. It is suggested to disable roaming feature,
in the past it leads to a known vulnerability.
Add to  *ssh_config* file::

    Host *
        UseRoaming no

Disable Root Logins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to not enable root login via SSH, this account has high privileges and it is usually target of attacks.
A good practice is to login with a normal user, the root account is still available by using *su* and *sudo* tools.
To disallow logins with user root, edit */sshd_config* file and make sure you have the following entry::

    PermitRootLogin no

Disable SSH forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port forwarding via SSH (SSH tunneling) creates a secure connection between a local computer and a remote
machine through which services can be relayed.
It is suggested to disable this feature, update *sshd_config* with the following line::

    AllowTcpForwarding no

Sometimes you would enable SSH forwarding just for some users, for example the following lines enable it for
foobar::

    AllowTcpForwarding no
    Match User foobar
    AllowTcpForwarding yes

Disable TCP forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH supports "traffic tunneling", it is used to forward TCP traffic over SSH channel.
If you are not using this feature it is suggested to disable it.
To disable TCP forwarding, edit *sshd_config* file and disable *AllowTcpForwarding*::

    AllowTcpForwarding no

Disable user environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users logging via SSH are usually able to set environment options and potentially bypass some access restrictions.
It is suggested, if this feature is not needed, to remove this permission, edit *sshd_config* file and disable
*PermitUserEnvironment*::

    PermitUserEnvironment no

Disable X11 forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH supports X display forwarding, so X11 applications started on the remote system via SSH have their display shown on
the client.
If this feature is not used it is suggested to disable it, although it is disabled by default in most distributions.
To disable X11 forwarding, edit *sshd_config* file and disable *X11Forwarding*::

    X11Forwarding no

Display a warning message before login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A pre login SSH banner shows before the password prompt, during an interactive session.
It is usually used for legal warnings or to show the terms by which someone is allowed to use the system.
This message is commonly located in */etc/issue* but you can also use your custom file, for example */etc/ssh/banner*.
It is suggested to use a warning banner, edit *sshd_config* file and set *Banner* option::

    Banner /etc/ssh/banner

Do not use SSH Agent Forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH Agent Forwarding is as an easy way to connect to a host with your SSH key and from there connect to another host with the same key.
For example this is used when you cannot connect directly to the second host from your workstation.
To enable SSH Agent Forwarding from command line you have to use ssh -A from command line or edit the AgentForward option in
your SSH configuration file.
It is suggested to not use SSH Agent Forwarding because it comes at cost of a security issue: a port-forwarding will be set up to
connect you to the second host, so anyone with sufficient permission on the first host could be able to use that socket to connect
to and use your local ssh-agent.
It is recommended to never use SSH Agent Forwarding, if it is really needed by your use case it is suggested to use the option
ProxyCommand instead.

Hash Known Hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a machine is compromised, a good idea is to minimize how much usable information is given to an attacker. The known_hosts
file is a source of relevant information.
*HashKnownHosts* is a configurable option, used to hash host names and addresses when they are added to *~/.ssh/known_hosts*.
It is suggested to enable it, addint to your SSH configuration file::

    HashKnownHosts Yes

Key storage
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to store your SSH keys in a secure storage and always encrypt your key files using a strong
password.
For example, you may want to store them on a secure and encrypted pendrive and only plug it in when you want
to use SSH.

Increase Key Strength
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to use a length more than the default one.
The following command instructs ssh-keygen with *-b* argument to generate a 4096-bit key::

    $ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Feel free to increase this to your desired key length although remember to use powers of two.
To slow down cracking attempts it is suggested to iterate the hash function many times, for example
iterating 6000 times using the *-a* option::

    $ ssh-keygen -b 4096  -a 6000 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Limit port forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't want to expose the ports you open with port forwarding to other people.
It is suggested to disable *GatewayPorts*, although in most distribution it is by default, to ensure that any
port forwarding is limited to the local machine::

    GatewayPorts no

Limiting brute forcing attempts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH is a service target of worms, script kiddies, and all kind of brute forcing around.
It's a good idea to limit the maximum amount of login tries for second. This can be achieved with a few iptables
lines or with `DenyHosts <http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Message authentication codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are multiple ways to combine ciphers and MACs but only Encrypt-then-MAC should be used.
It is suggested to use a selected list of MACs, edit *sshd_config* file::

    MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160,umac-128@openssh.com

Also set the same configuration for SSH client, edit  *ssh_config* file::

    Host *
        MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160,umac-128@openssh.com

OTP Setup
^^^^^^^^^

Usually SSH only verifies one thing, your password or your private key, although multiple authentication methods
were allowed.
Here we are going to see how to use Google Authentication as a OTP token during SSH authentication.
Install the Google Authenticator PAM module, for example in Ubuntu you can use this command::

    apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator

Run the command *google-authenticator* for each user you need an OTP token on your device, you will get some
questions to configure the token generator and at the end, a QR code will be displayed. Use it to setup your access
token, for example on your phone, and safely save all the codes displayed.

Configure SSH to use PAM editing *sshd_config* file with these values::

    ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
    PasswordAuthentication no
    AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive
    UsePAM yes
    PubkeyAuthentication yes

Restart the SSH service. Now edit the PAM configuration to use Google Authentication, edit /etc/pam.d/sshd and replace the line::

    @include common-auth

With the line::

    auth required pam_google_authenticator.so

Now SSH logins will require a private key, and after it will additionally require an OTP token.
Log in as the user you’ll be logging in with remotely and run the *google-authenticator* command to create a
secret key for that user.
Restart SSH deamon.

Restrict IP Listen Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are in a multi homed setup (with multiple network interfaces) it is suggested to avoid having SSH listening on
all interfaces, unless it is really needed. For example only a specific IP should be used for SSH.
To specify on which IP to listen, edit *sshd_config* file use *ListenAddress* option, for example to listen only on the
interface with IP 192.168.0.1::

    ListenAddress 192.168.0.1

Reduce Grace Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to lower the default grace time for authenticating a user, it is only necessary if you are on a very
slow connection otherwise it will hold unauthenticated connections open for some time.
To reduce the gracetime to 30 seconds, edit *sshd_config* file use *LoginGraceTime* option::

    LoginGraceTime 30

Route traffic over TOR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to provide an additional layer of encryption, server authentication and some traffic analysis
resistance you can access your SSH as an hidden service over TOR.
Note: Attackers can still attack the SSH service, but don't know who they are attacking.
This hardening step is not suggested, only a desiderata in needs of mention.

If you want to access your SSH daemon only via hidden service, bind it only to localhost, edit *sshd_config*::

    ListenAddress 127.0.0.1:22

Create youe hidden service editing *torrc* (usually in */etc/tor/torrc*)::

    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ssh
    HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

You will find the hostname you have to use in */var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ssh/hostname*.
Now you have to configure SSH client to connect over TOr. Install *socat* (it is used to route traffic over
TOR) and configure SSH to use *socat* for each domain ending with *.onion*, editing *ssh_config*::

    Host *.onion
        ProxyCommand socat - SOCKS4A:localhost:%h:%p,socksport=9050

Symmetric ciphers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Symmetric ciphers are used to encrypt the transmission after the initial key exchange and successful authentication.

It is suggested to use a selected list of strong ciphers, edit *sshd_config* file::

    Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

Also set the same configuration for SSH client, edit  *ssh_config* file::

    Host *
        Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

Use PAM
^^^^^^^

By default, OpenSSH uses PAM for the authentication of users.
PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a powerful framework for managing authentication of users.
Using PAM you can enforce rules during the authentication (i.e. limiting access based on login count).
It is suggested to use PAM for SSH authentication too, edit *sshd_config* file and enable *UsePAM*::

    UsePAM yes

Use privilege separation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is a good practice to never run processes as root, if yoi enable SSH privilege separation, the SSHd process has a
tiny footprint running as root and it drops privileges as soon as possible to run as unprivileged process.
It is suggested to enable privilege separation (usually it is enabled by default), edit */sshd_config* file and
enable *UsePrivilegeSeparation*::

    UsePrivilegeSeparation yes

Use strong key algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH supports different key exchange algorithms, ciphers and message authentication codes. There are ciphers for any
security level.
It is suggested to use only strong key exchange protocols, edit *sshd_config* file and set *KexAlgorithms*::

    KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

Edit *ssh_config* file and set *KexAlgorithms*::

    # Github needs diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 some of the time but not always.
    #Host github.com
    #    KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

    Host *
        KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

Open */etc/ssh/moduli* if exists, and delete lines where the 5th column is less than 2000::

    awk '$5 > 2000' /etc/ssh/moduli > "${HOME}/moduli"
    wc -l "${HOME}/moduli" # make sure there is something left
    mv "${HOME}/moduli" /etc/ssh/moduli
    If it does not exist, create it:

    ssh-keygen -G "${HOME}/moduli" -b 4096
    ssh-keygen -T /etc/ssh/moduli -f "${HOME}/moduli"
    rm "${HOME}/moduli"

Whitelisting / blacklisting users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default all systems user can login via SSH using their password or public key.
Sometime you create UNIX / Linux user account for ftp or email purpose. However, those user can login
to system using SSH.
To only allow antani and tapioco user to use the system via SSH, add the following to *sshd_config*::

    AllowUsers antani tapioco

Alternatively, you can allow all users to login via SSH but deny only a few users, with the following line::

    DenyUsers foo bar

You can also configure Linux PAM allows or deny login via the sshd server.

Whitelisting / blacklisting groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default all systems user can login via SSH using their password or public key.
Sometime you create UNIX / Linux user account for ftp or email purpose. However, those user can login
to system using SSH.
To only allow users in a group (fo example in the foo group), add the following to *sshd_config*::

    AllowGroups foo

Alternatively, you can allow all users to login via SSH but deny only the users in the foo group, with the following line::

    DenyGroups foo

You can also configure Linux PAM allows or deny login via the sshd server.
