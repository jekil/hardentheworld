Mac OSX 10.11 El Capitan
------------------------

According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan>`_ El
Capitan is *"(version 10.11) is the twelfth major release of OS X, Apple Inc.'s
desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. It is the successor
to OS X Yosemite and focuses mainly on performance, stability and security.
Following the California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X
Mavericks, El Capitan was named after a rock formation in Yosemite National
Park."*.

Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to keep the */Applications/* directory as clean as possible,
having a separate directory for your personal apps lets you do that easily.
Just create a folder named “Applications” in your home directory (or where you
like) and install all applications there. Apps installed via App Store or some
special apps cannot live in a custom Applications folder, so you have to keep
them in the original path.

Allow only signed apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to never run untrusted code not signed with a proper key.
To allow only apps signed by an authorized developer, go to:

    System Preferences ⇒ Security & Privacy ⇒ General

Set "Allow apps download from" to "Mac App Store and identified developers" or
if you want to be more strict and you install applications only via App Store
set it to "Mac App Store".

Check Privacy permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OS X allows you to track all applications requesting access to some sort of
sensitive data, for example your location or your contacts.
It is suggested to periodically check the list of applications requesting access
to sensitive data and review their permissions.
To show the list of these applications go to:

    System Preferences ⇒ Security & Privacy ⇒ Privacy

Destroy FileVault Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default File Vault keys are kept when system goes in standby mode.
As suggested by *man pmset*:

  destroyfvkeyonstandby - Destroy File Vault Key when going to standby
     mode. By default File vault keys are retained even when system goes to
     standby. If the keys are destroyed, user will be prompted to enter the
     password while coming out of standby mode.(value: 1 - Destroy, 0 -
     Retain)

It is suggested to configure your system to destroy File Vault keys when enterging
in standy mode with the following command::

  sudo pmset destroyfvkeyonstandby 1

Disable Bonjour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)>`_
Bonjour is *"Apple's implementation of Zero-configuration networking (Zeroconf),
a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and
hostname resolution. Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers,
and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast
Domain Name System (mDNS) service records".*

Bonjour sends some data about your OS on the network, so in some cases, in a not
trusted network you would like to disable it.

To disable Bonjour use the following command in a Terminal::

    sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ProgramArguments -array-add "-NoMulticastAdvertisements"

To enable Bonjour use the following command in a Terminal::

    sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ProgramArguments -array "/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder" "-launchd"

Disable Creation of Metadata Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default OS X creates metadata files in each directory to speed up browsing.
These files could leak metadata, it is suggested to avoid creation of .DS_Store
and AppleDouble files.

Disable Creation of Metadata Files on Network Volumes with the following command
in a Terminal::

    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true

Disable Creation of Metadata Files on USB Volumes with the following command
in a Terminal::

    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true

you should disable it.

Enable screen saver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to enable the screen saver to automatically lock your screen
after a while.
Go to:

    System Preferences ⇒ Desktop & Screen Saver ⇒ Screen Saver

Set "Start after" to "5 Minutes".

Empty trash securely
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you delete a file, OS X only deletes the index entry for the file, which
tells the system the file’s contents are free to be overwritten; however, the
data still remains and may be recovered using a forensics software.
It is a good practice to always empty your trash securely. Your data will be
securely wiped from disk in an irreversible way.
In the previous OS X releases there was an option to enable safe delete,  Apple
has removed this feature in OS X El Capitan. However, you can use command line
tools.

You can use the *rm* command from Terminal to delete files with the *-P* option,
as stated in *man rm* this option is used to:

    Overwrite regular files before deleting them. Files are
    overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff,
    then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.

For example if you what to delete *test.pdf* you should open Terminal and use::

    $ rm -P test.pdf

The *srm* command is specifically designed for secure deletion from command
line, as stated in *man srm*:

    srm  removes each specified file by overwriting, renaming, and truncating
    it before unlinking. This prevents other people from undeleting  or
    recovering any information about the file from the command line.

For example if you what to delete *test.pdf* you should open Terminal and use::

    $ srm test.pdf

Erase free space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, you might want to run an overwrite task on the free space of a
given drive.
You can use the *diskutil* command line utility, open Terminal and use::

    diskutil secureErase freespace LEVEL /Volumes/DRIVE_NAME

In this command, change LEVEL to a number of 0 through 4, the available options
are:
 * *0* is a single-pass of zeros
 * *1* is a single-pass of random numbers
 * *2* is a 7-pass erase
 * *3* is a 35-pass erase
 * *4* is a 3-pass erase

Change DRIVE_NAME to the name of the mount point.

Power off memory during standy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default during stand-by memeory are kept powered on, this is prone to
forensics acquisition of your memory.
As stated in *man pmset*:

  hibernatemode supports values of 0, 3, or 25. Whether or not a hiberna-
  tion image gets written is also dependent on the values of standby and
  autopoweroff

  For example, on desktops that support standby a hibernation image will be
  written after the specified standbydelay time. To disable hibernation
  images completely, ensure hibernatemode standby and autopoweroff are all
  set to 0.

  hibernatemode = 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory
  up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of mem-
  ory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically,
  plain old sleep.

  hibernatemode = 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy
  of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during
  sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to
  restore from hibernate image.

  hibernatemode = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a
  copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to
  memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hiberna-
  tion" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should
  use this setting.

It is suggested to power off memory at stand-by with the following command::

  sudo pmset hibernatemode 25

Require an administration password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Always require an administration password to access system settings.
Go to:

    System Preferences ⇒ Security & Privacy ⇒ Advanced

Check "Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences".

.. image:: images/settings_security_7.png
   :align: center

Require password to un-lock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requires password to un-lock from sleep or screen saver.
Go to:

    System Preferences ⇒ Security & Privacy ⇒ General

Set "Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins".

.. image:: images/settings_security_1.png
   :align: center

Save to Disk by Default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many applications bundled in OS X, i.e. Text, save by default new documents to
iCloud.
It is suggested to set default save target to be a local disk, not iCloud with
the following command, open Terminal and type::

    defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSDocumentSaveNewDocumentsToCloud -bool false

Set a Firmware Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enabling an optional firmware password offers an increased level of protection.
A firmware password is set on the actual Mac logicboards firmware, it is an EFI
password which prevents your Mac from being booted from an external boot volume,
single user mode, or target disk mode, and it also prevents resetting of PRAM
and the ability to boot into Safe Mode.
Years ago firmware passwords could be easily bypassed by removing memory.
These days Mac's firmware password isn't easily reset. Apple only suggests to
bring your Mac in to an authorized Apple Service Provider and have them do it
there.

It is suggested to set a firmware password:

 * Power off your Mac and turn it on.
 * Activate Recovery Mode (holding down the Command and R keys at boot).
 * After a while OS X Utilities will appear.
 * Click on the Utilities menu from the menu bar.
 * Select Firmware Password Utility.
 * Click on 'Turn On Firmware Password' and follow the wizard.
 * When done, restart your Mac.

Show all filename extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is a good practice to always show file names extensions.
Start Finder app.
Go to:

    Preferences ⇒ Advanced

Check "Show all filename extensions".

Show when localization is used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System services could ask to use localization data.
It is suggested to show location icon when localization data are requested.
Go to:

    System Preferences ⇒ Security & Privacy ⇒ Privacy ⇒ Location Services

Select "System Services" and click "Details...".
Check "Show location icon in the menu bar when System Services request your
location".

.. image:: images/settings_security_8.png

Users privilege separation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is suggested to use different accounts for administration and normal use.
Create an account with admin privileges for special tasks and maintenance and a
regular user for your normal use.
Don't use the same password for both.
